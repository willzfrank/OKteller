          <h6>GENERAL INFORMATION</h6>
          <p>
            The TOU constitute the entire agreement between you and OKTELLER and
            govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements
            between you and OKTELLER. The failure of OKTELLER to exercise or
            enforce any right or provision of the TOU shall not constitute a
            waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOU is
            found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the
            parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give
            effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and
            the other provisions of the TOU remain in full force and effect. You
            agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
            claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the
            Service or the TOU must be filed within one (1) year after such
            claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

                personal or identifying information about another person without
                that person's explicit consent, you agree to pay OKTELLER for
